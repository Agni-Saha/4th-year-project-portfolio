                            Technological advances are paving the way for improvements in many sectors of society. The education system
                            needs to undergo a transformation of existing pedagogical methods to maximize utilization of new technologies.
                            Traditional education system has primarily been teacher driven, lecture-based in one location. Advances in technology
                            are challenging existing paradigms by developing tools and educational environments that reach diverse learning
                            styles and surpass the boundaries of current teaching methods. On the other hand, the demand for graduates well
                            trained in software engineering principles and practices is also continuing to increase.

                            Matrix multiplication is a simple and common algorithm used in everyday calculation and scientific computing.
                            The purpose of this thesis was to attempt to speed up matrix multiplication by employing a network of closely
                            networked computers working in parallel to complete a single matrix multiplication. Having done this, the matrix
                            multiplication program was used as a tool for evaluating the performance and efficiency of this kind of
                            operation. The matrix multiplication algorithm was implemented using two different libraries for parallel computing. The
                            first is PVM, or Parallel Virtual Machine and the second is MPI or Message Passing Interface. Both libraries allow the
                            user to write parallel programs using an explicit message passing model. This means that the user can easily
                            spawn independent processes on different processors but is responsible for explicitly controlling all communication in
                            the form of sending and receiving data, between these processes. Here the implementation is done using PVM.

                            Matrix multiplication is one of the core components in many scientific computation and engineering applications.
                            It is the most simple and common algorithm used in everyday calculation. Most of the parallel algorithm was
                            implemented on specific architecture. Though the parallel algorithm gave their best result on that specific
                            architecture, the main disadvantage is that those architectures are very costly. In comparison to cluster
                            specially
                            cluster of workstations or cluster of PCs, which has becoming an appealing vehicle for parallel computing
                            nowadays.
                            In this paper we implement some of the algorithms, which have already been designed early and study their
                            characteristics, in cluster of PCs and compare their performance in terms of speedup and efficiency and try to

                            In this thesis the actual quality management of the software has been discussed incorporation with the
                            various
                            aspects of software matrx with respect to SDLC models. To analyse the quality of the software the waterfall
                            model
                            of Royce has been taken. For every phase of SDLC model some collected metrics and some design metrics are
                            introduced. Apartment from this there are phases pertaining to risk analysis and deployment for which some
                            metrics
                            are developed. After achieving all these metrics a SET OF METRICS has been selected to analyse the quality
                            of
                            Client server Model based Software. And by that SET OF METRICS a live software has been analysed. Severeal
                            potential weaknesses have been found during the analysis of the quality of the software. The entire thesis
                            is
                            aimed at the quality analysis of the software. Lastly some future works have been suggested which may help
                            in further enhancement of the quality assessment technique.

                            This thesis tells about stream cipher, one of the most popular encryption methodologies in recent days. At the beginning of
                            this thesis the structure and the properties of stream cipher were mentioned. Then various categories of stream ciphers were
                            discussed along with the different attacks on stream cipher. This thesis also describes one of the examples of stream cipher,
                            which is RC4. RC4 is one of the most widely used ciphers in practical software applications. In this thesis we examine 
                            security and design aspects of RC4.First we describe the functioning of RC4 and present many attacks on RC4. We then present
                            a new cipher, RC4B, with the goal of greater security with an algorithm comparable in simplicity to RC4. RC4B removes all 
                            the drawbacks of RC4.

                            In recent years the need for secure communication over computer networks has grown significantly, especially with the 
                            widespread use of the Internet for applications like online banking and other forms of e-commerce in which some form of 
                            public key cryptography is used. Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems provide more strength per bit than any other public-key 
                            cryptosystem known today. The algorithm is based on critical Elliptic curve arithmetic, which is discussed in this thesis
                            in details. The security of ECC is based on elliptic curve discrete logarithmic problem, which is also explained very
                            clearly here. It also tells about the advantages & application field of ECC algorithm.

                            bottlenecks in Oracle based systems and to design suitable methods to address them so as to meet the requirements 
                            of any end-user using the Oracle product. With the advent of Oracle, right from the days of Oracle 7, 8i , 9i to 10g
                            there has been the incorporation of certain features, some of which may be utilized in a efficient manner to meet
                            the business needs of any project as well as improve their performance. One of the features of a quality software 
                            product is obviously the satisfaction of the clients who use it, and in the case of a database system, a poorly 
                            performing query or a high system resource utilization may well be the cause of a fair amount of problem for all the

                            Though a lot of factors, directly or indirectly affect the system performance, in this analysis, more emphasis is given
                            to SQL tuning and the efficient ways of addressing response time or throughput issues. The case studies and examples
                            which are considered here are more aligned to Datawarehouse systems, as large volumes of data, both static as well as
                            dynamic, can be thought of in such systems and these provide ample scope for proper capacity planning and projected
                            growth estimation as the system load, number of users as well as applications accessing them and their functional 
                            complexity  keep on increasing  with time. The process in which the Oracle optimizer reacts to any query and chooses
                            the desired path of execution is also dealt with here, with reference to specific outputs of Explain Plan utility.
                            The issue of tuning extract queries is studied in details, with proper reference to indexing strategies and hints
                            introduced to improve the output.

                            This analysis focuses both on performance problem diagnosis as well as their possible fixes. However, here other common
                            performance tools like products of Mercury, load runner or even the WISE tool (Workload Interface Statistics Engine)
                            are not considered, rather each specific tuning issue is dealt by a case to case basis, considering the amount of data,
                            activity as well as the resources involved in the system. In fact, the discussion here reveals that the data in the
                            Oracle�s dynamic data dictionary views or v$ views may not always reveal all the system problems, rather the business
                            logic and design intents of the software may largely influence them. Also many a times details may not be perfectly
                            extrapolated well from an aggregate, in the sense that the issue with an individual program may not be rectified
                            fully by examining only the system wide statistics for the whole instance. Since broadly, tuning involves 
                            application tuning, instance and database tuning, environment tuning as well as specialized tuning hence proper
                            configuration management of codes and components as well as parameters is equally important as a specific change,
                            in case not effective, would imply going back to the earlier working version. Though every system is unique in
                            its own way, by means of data, logic, design  or processing methods, it would be much helpful if these guidelines
                            considered here, including indexing, partitioning strategies and Real Application Cluster concepts be applied
                            to any generalized Oracle based systems on any Hardware or Operating System platform in order to derive the
                            maximum performance gain from them.

                            Factoring integers is perhaps the quintessential example of the importance of computers in mathematics. It is one of
                            the oldest and most troublesome problems in mathematics. However, only in the last two or three decades has real progress
                            been made.
                            The problem of finding the prime factors of large composite numbers has always been of mathematical interest. With the
                            advent of public key cryptosystems, it is also of practical importance, because the security of some of these 
                            cryptosystems, such as the Rivest-Shamir-Adelman(RSA) system, depends on the difficulty of factoring the public keys.
                            In recent years the best known integer factorization algorithms have improved greatly to the point where it is now easy
                            to factor a 60 decimal digit number and possible to factor numbers larger than 120 decimal digits, given the
                            availability of enough computing power.
                            This thesis is about using computers for factoring. Our emphasis is on how to correctly and efficiently put these
                            algorithms on computers. Our main interests are in the implementation of the simple integer factorization algorithm
                            and the possible approach for parallelization of this algorithm. In this paper, a factorization method is
                            properly defined based on square root technique for cryptographic applications. It is applied and tested to any n-bits
                            (n{'>'}32) integer factorization, particularly on RSA algorithm. Further, security issues on RSA are discussed.
                            We describe several algorithms, including the elliptic curve method(ECM) and the multiple-polynomial quadratic 
                            sieve(MPQS) algorithm.

                            Matrix multiplication is one of the core components in many scientific computation and Engineering applications.
                            It is the most simple and common algorithm used in everyday calculation. Most of the parallel algorithms are
                            implemented on specific architecture. Though the parallel algorithms give their best result on that specific architecture,
                            the main disadvantage is that those architectures are very costly in comparison to cluster specially cluster of
                            workstations or cluster of PCs, which has becoming an appealing vehicle for parallel computing nowadays. In this thesis,
                            we implement some of the algorithms in cluster (i.e. in distributed memory environment), which have already been designed
                            earlier, and we compare their performance in terms of speedup and efficiency and try to find out the best algorithm, which
                            gives best speedup and requires least memory.

                            In recent years the need for secure public key cryptography grown vastly as they provide more strength. Elliptic
                            Curve Cryptosystems (ECC) is one of the public key cryptosystem that provide more strength per bit than any other 
                            public -key cryptosystem known today. As increase of key size in ECC the strength is also increases. The implementation
                            of algorithms for ECC technique in �C� is bound to a certain range of key size i.e. we can not generate a key
                            having size more than the range that supported by �C�. If we want to generate a key having size more than the range
                            then we have to incorporate a special library called GMP Library in our implementation. This library provides some
                            features that support to operate on big integers. Now using GMP Library we can get big size key in order to provide
                            more strength in ECC.. 
                            This thesis aims in discussing about the implementation of ECC techniques using GMP Library and the time taken to
                            generate different key having different size and also time taken to encrypt and decrypt plaintext having different
                            size using different key size.

                            Integer factorization means factoring a large integer into smaller factors. Mathematicians have been working on this 
                            problem for centuries. Various algorithms have been designed with the intention to successfully factor integers in a 
                            reasonably short time. However the problem of factoring large numbers say around 100 digits still remained a problem, 
                            until the advent of quadratic sieve and then the general number field sieve algorithm. Now a 60 digit number can be 
                            factored with considerable ease. Even 100 digit number can be factored nowadays.
                            We describe several integer factorization algorithms. Some are very simple to understand and implement while others 
                            are quite mathematically involved and requires a fairly strong background in mathematics.

                            I/O is a very important part of computing, but it has been "overlooked" by the emphasis placed on ever increasing computing
                            (CPU) power. Great advances have been made in improving the computation and communication performance of parallel machines, 
                            but their I/O performance is lagging far behind. The paper will introduce parallel I/O as the ability for multiple tasks to 
                            read/write the same file (different portions) simultaneously and multiple users to read/write to the same disk space 
                            simultaneously or the programmer to accomplish all of the above by using an easy, high level interface, and a performance 
                            comparison is drawn with serial I/O. Implementing parallel I/O is a very complex task which involves independently complex
                            issues. It can involve some/all of the following factors: Multiprocessors with parallel access to multiple disks, Hardware 
                            architecture (ex: disk striping), Operating system support (ex: pre-fetching, cache coherency), Parallel databases, 
                            Networking (ex: SP2 I/O over switch versus Ethernet), Algorithms, Software & language support, programmer interfaces 
                            (ex: MPI-I/O). Basically, parallel I/O solves the short comings of serial I/O, such as allowing large file sizes, 
                            scalability and speedup. However, most of the advantages to serial I/O like ease of use and standardization are lost.

                            Every enterprise that has been using IT as a business enabler is thinking of, discussing about or
                            experimenting with Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). If there is a hit parade of IT acronyms
                            today, SOA or Service Oriented Architecture, would surely be number one. Today, we see that
                            most of the large and medium-sized organizations are struggling to adapt to the vibrant and
                            dynamic business environment and maintain the leadership position. It is all about surviving and
                            thriving in an extremely dynamic and fast changing market. The fuelling need for g-localization
                            (globalization with local flavor), business diversification, mergers and acquisition impose unique
                            technology challenges for such an enterprise. These challenges are a direct outcome of the
                            historical technology proliferation within the IT eco-system of the enterprises. As a result, business
                            faces real-life issues with respect to time-to-market, profitability, operational efficiencies and costs.
                            In such circumstances, agility (responsiveness), efficiency (cost-reduction) and adaptability
                            (resilience to change) in providing business-centric technology-solutions become important for the organization.
                            Conservative enterprises typically go through a long time consuming cycle in order to respond to a
                            change, be it an opportunity or a threat. What is required is a �Self-Optimizing Enterprise� that has
                            a superior ability to sense and respond to the market opportunities with speed, efficiency and
                            resilience. A �Self-Optimizing Enterprise� of today must dynamically optimize its processes and
                            resources to exploit the prevailing market dynamics.
                            To live up to this aspiration of an enterprise to be agile, efficient and adaptable we need to
                            effectively adopt the emerging Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) technologies to realize:
                            � An IT solution delivery mechanism to seamlessly link together the business services and
                            processes � A network of distributed business services and processes on a virtually integrated IT
                            infrastructure � Enterprise-level visibility in an end-to-end business process execution
                            Is this possible? What are the concepts and technology which can enable this? Is the technology
                            acceptable to business and mature enough to implement? Can the business and IT cohesively
                            exploit the IT landscape, without getting into the mess-maze of applications, systems and platforms
                            that IT makes the business to grapple with? And will this add business value to the organization
                            rather than just being a technology marvel?
                            The objective of the project is to address above queries by describing the entire landscape of SOA.
                            To correlate the SOA paradigm to an industry, Utility industry has been considered which can be
                            immensely benefited by embracing SOA. The evolution of IT in utility industry, viz. the Power
                            industry has been described with specific benefits that SOA can bring to this industry. As part of
                            this project, the entire business process of a world class utility company has been defined and the
                            service mosaic for such a utility company has also been designed. Finally, SOA solution mapping
                            with leading vendors� product has been made for the purpose of implementation.

                            public key cryptography is used. Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems provide more strength per bit than any other public -key 
                            cryptosystem known today. The algorithm is based on critical Elliptic curve arithmetic, which is discussed in this thesis 
                            in details. The security of ECC is based on elliptic curve discrete logarithmic problem, which is also explained very clearly 
                            here. It also tells about the advantages & application field of ECC algorithm.
                            This thesis aims in discussing about the implementation of ECC encryption & decryption algorithm and the time taken for

                            Sorting is one of most studied problems in computer science because of its theoretical interest and practical importance. 
                            With the advent of parallel processing, parallel sorting has become an important area for algorithm research. Although 
                            considerable work has been done on the theory of parallel sorting and but good parallel performance on a variety of 
                            multiprocessor with a large number of processors remains a challenging problem. Based on the general strategies utilized, 
                            most parallel sorts suitable for multiprocessor computers can be placed into one of two rough categories: merge based 
                            sorts and partition-based sorts. Merge-based sorts consist of multiple merge stages across processors, and perform well 
                            only with a small number of processors. When the number of processors utilized gets large, so does the overhead of 
                            scheduling and synchronization, which reduces the speedup. Partition-based sorts consist of two phases: partitioning 
                            the data set into smaller subsets such that all elements in one subset are no greater than any element in another, 
                            and sorting each subset in parallel. The performance of partition-based sorts primarily depends on how well the data 
                            can be evenly partitioned

                            This thesis presents mainly partition-based parallel sorting techniques, their advantages and disadvantages. Depending 
                            upon efficient pivot choosing and load balancing we have considered the algorithm Parallel Sorting by Regular 
                            Sampling(PSRS) for our experiment. Within this thesis we then designed and implemented the PSRS algorithm in MPI. 
                            So this thesis describes a new parallel sorting algorithm suitable for a variety of multiprocessor architectures.  
                            PSRS finds pivots for partitioning the data into ordered subsets of approximately equal size by using a regular sample 
                            from sorted sublists of the data. It is proven that this form of sampling results in all processors being within a 
                            factor of two of achieving ideal load balancing.

                            Integer factorization is a well-studied topic. Parts of the cryptography we use each day rely on the fact that this 
                            problem is difficult. One method one can use for factorizing a large composite number is the Quadratic Sieve algorithm. 
                            This method is among the best known today. We present a parallel implementation of the Quadratic Sieve using the 
                            Message Passing Interface (MPI). We also discuss the performance of the different number of nodes, which shows that 
                            this approach is a good one.

                            In recent years the need for secure communication over computer networks has grown significantly, especially with 
                            the widespread use of the Internet for applications like online banking and other forms of e-commerce in which some

                            public -key cryptosystem known today.  The security of ECC is based on elliptic curve discrete logarithmic problem, 
                            which is also explained very clearly here. It also tells about the advantages & application field of ECC algorithm. 
                            In this thesis we described the Baby Step, Giant Step method to break elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem to 
                            increase the industry�s understanding and appreciation for the difficulty of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm

                            Then the thesis presents the experimental results which shows that implementation of PSRS algorithm using Pthreads on a 
                            multiprocessor machine reduces the time to sort large number of elements to a great extent. Thus, as on one hand this approach 
                            eliminates the need of multiple computers to be involved to perform a single program, on the other hand, it reduces the 
                            computation time of the program which is actually the main purpose of parallelisation of any algorithm.

                            In mathematics, the theory of linear systems is a branch of linear algebra, a subject which is fundamental to 
                            modern mathematics. Computational algorithms for finding the solutions are an important part of numerical linear 
                            algebra, and such methods play a prominent role in engineering, physics, chemistry, computer science, statistics and 
                            economics. Many scientific & engineering field like structural analysis (civil engineering), heat transport 
                            (mechanical engineering), analysis of power grids (electrical engineering), production planning (economics), 
                            regression analysis (statistics) problems can take the form of a system of linear equations. There are many algorithms 
                            are used to solve the system of linear equations. Since linear systems are derived from realistic problems are often 
                            quite large. It is required to study and analysis how to solve them efficiently on parallel computers.
                            One of the most efficient direct method to solve the linear system is Gauss Elimination which is alone is sufficient 
                            for many applications. But na�ve Gauss Elimination has some pitfall which can be overcome by Gauss Elimination with 
                            Partial Pivoting algorithm. This algorithm is useful to solve the liner system with millions number of unknown variables. 
                            So it�s a good point to start the parallelization of this useful algorithm.
                            Within our thesis we developed two parallel approaches of this algorithm row oriented and column oriented approaches by 
                            pthread which is applicable for multiprocessor machines. With the experimental result we saw that Row oriented approach 
                            of this algorithm gives much better results in comparison to column oriented approach of this algorithm. The speedup 
                            and efficiency of number of variables with respect to number of processors becomes more and more ideal when the number 
                            of variables is increasing in case of row oriented parallelization of GEPP, which is required for parallelization. 
                            Row oriented approach is suitable when number of variables is much more grater than the number of processors. The 
                            column oriented approach is suitable just for the opposite when number of variables is lesser than the number of 
                            processors.

                            security equivalent to RSA, but it uses a smaller key size. In this thesis, we present an overview of public key 
                            cryptography based on the discrete logarithm problem of both finite fields and elliptic curves. We discuss one of 
                            the basic and important properties of elliptic curves, the group law, and show that the set of points on the curve 
                            forms an additive abelian group. We show how the order of this abelian group affects the discrete logarithm problem 
                            and hence the security of a public key cryptosystem. We present the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange and ElGamal cryptosystem 
                            based on the discrete logarithm problem of finite fields and also give their analogues in the elliptic curve domain.
                            Finally, the thesis aims to discuss the implementations of Elliptic Curve Based Diffie Hellman Key Exchange and Elliptic 
                            Curve Based El Gamal Cryptosystem.

                            Sorting is one of most studied problems in computer science because of its theoretical interest and practical 
                            importance. With the advent of parallel processing, parallel sorting has become an important area for algorithm 
                            research. Parallel sorting plays a pivotal role in parallel programming environment.
                            This thesis presents mainly parallel sorting techniques, their advantages and disadvantages. We have considered the 
                            algorithm Counting Sort for our experiment which is suitable for a variety of multiprocessor architectures. We have 
                            then designed and implemented the Counting sort algorithm using Pthreads. Pthreads enable us to carry out the algorithm 
                            on a multi-processor machine by dividing the task among the multiple processors.
                            Then the thesis presents the experimental results which shows that implementation of Counting Sort algorithm using 
                            Pthreads on a multiprocessor machine reduces the time to sort large number of elements to a great extent. Thus, as on 
                            one hand this approach eliminates the need of multiple computers to be involved to perform a single program, on the 
                            other hand, it reduces the computation time of the program which is actually the main purpose of parallelisation of 
                            any algorithm.
                            At last thesis presents the scope for further work and concludes the thesis. It is followed by appendices describing 
                            the Pthread header file, Pthread calls used during the program implementation and how to run the code.

                            To have secure data communication among hosts, assurances are typically required both that data actually is coming 
                            from its reputed source (data origin authentication) and that it is unaltered (data integrity).Encryption - decryption 
                            process alone has been found ineffective to take care of the combined issue. Hash functions, on the other hand, in 
                            conjunction with other cryptographic schemes are used for data integrity (Manipulation Detection Code) and source 
                            authentication (Message authentication code) together with reducing the task of protecting the integrity of the 
                            entire message to that of the hash code only.
                            With time, various kinds of cryptanalytic attacks have been devised to which most of the existing hash algorithms 
                            fall prey. But fortunately enough, endeavors on part of cryptographers to come up with new hashing algorithms, have 
                            not lagged behind and the incessantly increasing storage capacities of computers has facilitated such complex 
                            procedures providing these an opportunity to exploit the parallel processing platform of recent times.
                            MD6 Hash function proposed by Ronald L.Rivest in October 2008 is a simple, robust, provably secure, flexible efficient 
                            hashing algorithm working extremely well for multicore or parallel processors. Based on Merkle�s tree model, it 
                            forms a
                            4-ary tree which is highly parallelizable, but to maintain a balance between parallelism and memory requirements, 
                            it can be made to switch to a sequential, iterative Merkle-Damgard mode of operation having minimal memory need. 
                            It can be used both in keyed or unkeyed version and comprises of simple data operations like AND,XOR,SHIFT  all 
                            operating on 64 bit words.
                            The thesis aims at providing an overview of the MD6 Hash function, specifying its input and output formats, modes 
                            of operation, design considerations and aspects of security against various prevalent attacks. It also discusses 
                            the implementation of this algorithm in C language and overviews the multi threaded implementation of the same that 
                            has been tailored to suit the parallel processing platform to obtain improvement in performance with respect to 
                            time, relative to the single processor implementation. The thesis makes an humble effort to discuss and analyze 
                            the experimental results thus obtained.

                            One of the well known polyalphabetic ciphers is the Playfair cipher. In this
                            cipher digrams or groups of 2 letters in the plain text is converted to cipher
                            text digrams during encryption using a key. Similarly during decryption
                            cipher text digrams are converted to plain text digrams using the same key.
                            However the original 5 x 5 Playfair cipher can support only 25 uppercase
                            alphabets. To overcome this drawback we propose a rectangular matrix
                            having 10 columns and 9 rows which can support almost all the printable
                            characters including white space. This thesis looks at cryptography and then
                            classical cryptography, analyses the original Playfair cipher and the different
                            variations that have been proposed and finally the Modified Playfair cipher is
                            presented and analysed. Cryptanalysis is done to show that the proposed
                            cipher is a stronger one than the traditional Playfair cipher. At the last thesis
                            presents the scope for further work and concludes the thesis.

                            The past few years have marked the start of a historic transition from sequential to
                            parallel computation. The necessity to write parallel programs is increasing as systems
                            are getting more complex while processor speed increases are slowing down. Current
                            parallel programming uses low-level programming constructs like threads and explicit
                            synchronization (for example, locks, semaphores and monitors) to coordinate thread
                            execution. Parallel programs written with these constructs are difficult to design, program
                            and debug. Also locks have many drawbacks which make them a suboptimal solution.

                            Software Estimation is responsive to the widespread problems the software industry
                            has experienced in creating meaningful cost and sch edule estimates. Software
                            estimation is not as hard or mysterious as many people think, but the knowledge of
                            how to create effective estimates has not been well publicized. Software Estimation
                            provides a comprehensive set of tips and heuristics that software developers, technical
                            leads, and project managers can apply to create more accurate estimates. It presents
                            fundamental estimation techniques and addresses specific estimation challenges. It
                            explains how to avoid common pitfalls. Software Estimation doesn�t avoid hairy

                            This paper provides a general overview of software cost estimation methods for Data
                            Warehousing projects including the recent advances in the field. As a number of these
                            models rely on a software size estimate as input, we first provide an overview of
                            common size metrics. We then highlight the cost estimation models that have been
                            proposed and used successfully. Models are being classified into 2 major categories:
                            Function Point Based and Component Based. Each has its own strengths and
                            weaknesses. A key factor in selecting a cost estimation model is the accuracy of its
                            estimates. Fortunately, with the large body of experience with estimation models, the
                            accuracy of these models is satisfactory except few specific cases. This paper includes
                            description of these newer approaches to cost estimation for Data Warehousing
                            projects.

                            In the recent years public-key cryptography has been proved so useful for
                            securing communications that it has become pervasive in modern life. Elliptic
                            Curve Cryptography (ECC) is one of the public-key cryptosystems that provide
                            more security per bit than any other public-key cryptosystem known today.
                            ECC can use a considerably shorter key and offer the same level of security
                            as other asymmetric algorithms using much larger ones, thereby reducing
                            processing overhead.

                            Distributed Computing and Network Communication has revolutionized the face of modern
                            computing. But it brings with it serious security concerns like verifying the integrity and
                            authenticity of the transmitted data. The sender and the receiver communicating over an
                            insecure channel essentially require a method by which the information transmitted by the
                            sender can be easily authenticated by the receiver as "unmodified" (authentic). Techniques
                            such as Encryption can protect against passive attacks like eavesdropping but for active attack
                            like falsification of data, Message Authentication Code (MAC) is needed. A modern technique
                            that relies on a related family of functions called Hash Functions provides message
                            authentication. Cryptographic Hash Functions have many applications such as Digital
                            Signatures, Time Stamping Methods and File Modification Detection Methods. NIST SHA-3
                            Keccak is the latest Hash Function selected as the winner of NIST Hash Function Competition.
                            SHA-3 is not meant to replace SHA-2 as no significant attacks on SHA-2 have been
                            demonstrated. But it is designed in response to the need to find an alternative and dissimilar
                            construct for Cryptographic Hash that is more fortified to attacks. In the subsequent sections a
                            detailed analysis of the software implementation of NIST SHA-3 Keccak Sponge Function and
                            its performance is being carried out under laboratory setup.

                            for smart cities. Citizens want efficient and economical road transport
                            systems to save time. Transport management authorities aim to build

                            tasks for intelligent traffic systems. Trip underreporting has long been a

                            This thesis work represents a novel approach of dynamic trip detection
                            based on the real time inputs like GPS data, number of passenger(s)
                            boarded/disembarked etc. Hardware complexities are kept very low by not
                            using any of the OBD (On board diagnostics) port data. Commuters can
                            efficiently plan their journey from the real time alerts received from the
                            system. An automated trip report will be generated containing data like
                            authorized/unauthorized passengers boarded/disembarked, maximum bus
                            speed, bus seat utilization, trip start and end time and net kilometer run,
                            which will enhance the transport management. This dynamic trip detection
                            algorithm resolves the entire problem since the data is real time and also
                            considering the extreme corner cases related to network traffic, road traffic,

                            Today the use of random numbers is in a great extent in the field of well-designed cryptographic application. Starting from 
                            Session keys, initialization vectors, salts to be hashed with passwords, unique parameters in digital signature operations, 
                            and even to nonces in protocols, all are assumed to be random by system designers. This thesis approaches towards the 
                            generation of pseudo-random numbers based on already established cryptographic primitive. Generally, PRNGs can be typically 
                            constructed from some cryptographic primitives, and Hash function is one of them. Here the proposed construction is based on 
                            Latest standardized Hash function SHA3(in Hexadecimal domain). Being an iterated approach, before absorbing, the implemented 
                            generator processes seed blocks (like padding), and also allows to interleave the feeding of multiple seed materials at a 
                            regular interval, directly calculated with the help of number of output bits and number of seeds, as per specification or 
                            need of users i.e. how many absorbs are needed, and thus outputting of pseudo random numbers up to desired length, in a 
                            continuous fashion. Absorbing at pre-calculated regular interval and Thus the entropy within the seeds are assumed to be 
                            diffused within the state of the proposed generator as well as the output strings. This approach is a Generalization, based on 
                            Hash function, rather than starting from the scratch. It takes its security aspects, directly from SHA3 security model, Sponge 
                            here. Lastly, pseudo randomness of the generated output sequences is also tested using NIST test-suite package, upon the files 
                            generated from implemented PRNG.

                            In the modern times there has been an exponential growth in mobile usage. As the mobile technology giants continue 
                            to battle it out through innovation, new functionality, lowering price barriers and the availability of mobile devices; 
                            we as users will continue to benefit and the adoption of mobile devices will continue to grow. We are already starting 
                            to experience the inevitable reality that mobile devices will become the primary medium to access the internet across 
                            all age groups and markets. Every day, more and more users are using their mobile devices to access and retrieve 
                            information via mobile browsers, view multimedia and other rich content, connect to social networking sites and even 
                            make retail transactions. As a result now, website developers must consider how to optimize their online presence for 
                            a user who can reach them at any time from any device.
                            The explosion of mobile internet browsing has reversed this. The lower bandwidth, higher latency, smaller memories, and 
                            lower processing power of mobile devices have imposed a heightened need to optimize site performance to meet consumer 
                            expectations. No matter how interesting, beautiful, or cleverly interactive web pages are, if they take more than 2 or 
                            3 seconds to render, whether on a desktop or a mobile device, users quickly become impatient. They are measurably less 
                            likely to convert from browsing to buying and may even hit the Back button or close the browser before the page ever 
                            loads. Hence the need to optimize the performance of websites for viewing in mobile devices has acquired huge importance. 
                            Optimizing will not only assist in acquiring a competitive advantage, it will also ensure positive interactions 
                            between the business and its customers.
                            This thesis researches the different approaches used for mobile website optimization and then studies in detail the 
                            technique of using caching to improve performance. Decreasing the amount of processing a Web server must do to comply 
                            with individual requests results in quicker response times, the server's ability to handle more concurrent requests, 
                            and a reduced load on intermediate and back-end data systems. This translates to faster loading times on the devices. 
                            When a site gets repeated requests for the same information and the information does not need to be modified for each person, 
                            and it's not time sensitive, instead of re-fetching or recalculating it, the data can be fetched once and then the 
                            results stored. The next time a request comes in for that information, it is retrieved from the cache.
                            This approach is implemented and tested on different devices for pages of varying graphic richness.  On an average 42% 
                            performance gain was observed in terms of response time making the solution viable. The performance improvement resulted 
                            in lesser server requests per page and response payload as well as better user experience.

                            The past few years have marked the start of a historic transition from sequential toparallel computation. The necessity 
                            to write parallel programs is increasing as systemsare getting more complex while processor speed increases are slowing 
                            down. Current parallel programming uses low-level programming constructs like threads and explicit synchronization 
                            (for example, locks, semaphores and monitors)to coordinate thread execution. Parallel programs written with these 
                            constructs are difficult to design, program and debug. Also locks have many drawbacks which make them a suboptimal solution.
                            Software Transactional Memory (STM) is a promising new approach to programming shared-memory parallel processors. 
                            It is a concurrency control mechanism that is widely considered to be easier to use by programmers than other 
                            mechanisms such as locking. It allows portions of a program to execute in isolation, without regard to other, 
                            concurrently executing tasks. A programmer can reason about the correctness of code within a transaction and 
                            need not worry about complex interactions with other, concurrently executing parts of the program. But the drawback 
                            of STM is that the speed of code using STM is slower than that of code using locks.
                            This thesis presents the concept of Software Transactional Memory (STM), its various advantages and limitations and 
                            the concept of writing code using STM. It also shows how the performance of STM can be improved.

                            From processing speed to heat dissipation to data collection to event generation
                            everything has improved. In addition, development of sensor technology has led to
                            monitoring of many events in real time. Because of such enriched data and event
                            generation capabilities processing of all of these data in real time and on the fly are
                            extremely important. Otherwise storing all these data in database and retrieving these
                            data for analysis is not feasible. Processing these data in run time involves not only the
                            question of implementation ot processing logic but also sharing the processing loads
                            among available cores. Distribution of loads among multiple processors is not straight
                            forward to implement. It's not possible to distribute loads using only one single process,
                            so multi-process/multi-thread implementation comes into picture. Managing and
                            operation of all these processes and threads involves synchronization for which "lock"
                            mechanism is required. But overall it has become cumbersome to implement and debug
                            codes involving locks.

                            Smart grids being increasingly used in modern power systems, employ smart devices
                            (meters and sensor nodes) that constantly generate data and communicate with their en-
                            vironment. For such pervasive systems to work properly they must overcome a number
                            of constraints. Due to resource constrained nature of the devices and limited bandwidth
                            of the communication channel, the messages must be short and security overhead be
                            minimal. Secondly, for messages to be trusted by their recipients, they must be authen-
                            ticated. Furthermore different messages from many different devices (signers) must be
                            processed and verified quickly.

                            short signatures, but they take significantly more time to verify. In our scheme we use
                            a constant number (three) of pairing operations, irrespective of the number of devices
                            whose data needs to be verified and hence is more efficient in terms of computation time.
                            Communication overhead is also low due to short signatures used.

                            For source authentication and data integrity of messages, they are signed. However,
                            multiple message signature pair results in large overhead. To avoid this, signatures are
                            batched. Our work is based on the batch verification of a large number of short signatures
                            so that fast processing and real time analysis of data can be carried out.

                            Synchronization for a shared resource is notoriously complex and can leads to issues like deadlock 
                            and starvation. These issues are amplified on a Distributed Shared Memory environment as the processes are 
                            physically separate. Dining Philosophers Problem represent the large class of problems that faces these challenges.
                            A number of solutions for Dining Philosophers Problem have been given over the course of time but mainly 
                            for shared memory environment. In this thesis paper we try to devise a solution for it in Distributed Shared 
                            Memory environment and also implemented it and checked for its robustness.
                            We have shown that our solution ensures deadlock prevention as well as starvation. We have also analysed our 
                            experimental results and provided a comparative study of the solutions in two different environments.

                            Objective of parallel programming is to solve problems which are too complex with theoretical approaches 
                            such as global climate modeling which demand more computational resources than a single processor machine 
                            can provide. In the last decade, an important research topic was to leverage the power of inexpensive networked 
                            workstations for parallel applications. Application software can be made to run in a very high speed by using 
                            as many processors as possible in a concurrent setting instead of doing the same on a single processor. 
                            Theoretically if software is allowed to run on 10 processors, for example, then correspondingly the rate 
                            of execution speed can go upto 10 times faster. Thus many large computational problems can be solved in a 
                            cost-effective manner by making use of the aggregate power and memory of many heterogeneous computing 
                            systems. Performance issue can also be addressed using the parallel programming in distributed shared 
                            environment. In DSM software implementation approach, the workload of large software applications can be 
                            split into many smaller tasks and shared among many available processors, which cooperate in accomplishing 
                            the original application. Another advantage with this is that the parallelized software can run on complex, 
                            heterogeneous sets of computing systems, which includes multi-processor systems. There are two primary paradigms 
                            which are mainly used for developing any software in parallel processing: Message-passing and Parallelism by 
                            compilers. Parallel compilers are compilers that can create parallel execution from seemingly sequential program 
                            source code. These compilers can decompose a program and insert the necessary message-passing structures. Message
                            -passing has emerged as one of the more widely-used paradigms for expressing parallel algorithms. Its expressive 
                            power has proven adequate for writing parallel programs and its close match with the hardware of many current 
                            parallel computers (including workstation networks) has made it possible for the programs to exploit the full 
                            capabilities of most current hardware. Message-passing is becoming a paradigm to being a "standard" approach for 
                            implementation of parallel applications and provides a common Application Programming Interface (API). Currently 
                            research works are going on for designing robust algorithms using message-passing paradigm and classifying 
                            applications in science and engineering based on message-passing. Thus Open MPI is a specification for a set 
                            of compiler directives, library routines, and environment variables that can be used to specify shared memory
                             parallelism.

                            Cryptography is the science of writing in secret code and is an ancient art; the first documented use of 
                            cryptography in writing dates back to circa 1900 B.C. when an Egyptian scribe used non-standard hieroglyphs 
                            in an inscription. 
                            Most of the cryptographic algorithms have some problem. The earlier ciphers can be broken with ease on 
                            modern computation systems. In 1984, Adi Shamir proposed an ID-based encryption method. However, this was only 
                            an instantiation of identity-based signatures and it remained an open problem.
                            In 2001, the pairing based Boneh-Franklin scheme solved the IBE problem.
                            This thesis is a research outcome of a suitable Chat Server and Client application development using Java 
                            programming language that utilizes Boneh-Franklin scheme to use pairing based cryptography and IBE to encrypt 
                            chat messages transmitted among users.
                            The application is cross platform is nature and has been tested and verified in Windows and GNU/Linux environments.

                            Image Edge detection is one of the fundamental steps in image processing, image analysis, image pattern 
                            recognition, and computer vision techniques. Edge detection includes a variety of mathematical methods 
                            that aim at identifying points in a digital image at which the image brightness changes sharply or, more 
                            formally, has discontinuities. The purpose of detecting sharp changes in image brightness is to capture 
                            important and crucial properties of an image. Hence, detecting edge of an image is an important aspect in 
                            the world of digital image processing. In this thesis, Parallel Programming is proposed for image edge 
                            detection to make the algorithms run faster and also to make efficient use of the available resources. This 
                            thesis parallelizes some traditional well known image edge detection algorithms (Sobel Edge Detection Algorithm, 
                            Prewitt Edge Detection Algorithm) using various Parallel Programming techniques (Thread programming for Shared

                            of security that its use has become pervasive in modern life. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
                            is one of the public-key cryptosystems that has been proven to be the most efficient public-key
                            cryptosystem till date. Pairing function over two elliptic curve points provides a building block
                            for cryptographic operations. The bilinearity property of pairing incorporates many cryptosystems

                            Traffic congestion has become a major problem in our day today life throughout the world. Due the congestion 
                            our day to day life has become more strenuous and apart from this it is effecting our environment.
                            In this thesis paper I have discussed with traffic congestion problem and it effect. I have proposed a computer 
                            based model using parallel computing which can reduce the problem to some extent. At the end I have done the 
                            implementation of the same.
                            In the solution I have used parallel programming to implement the traffic model. Threads are one of several 
                            technologies that make it possible to execute multiple code paths concurrently inside a single application. I have 
                            done the thread programming using shared memory approach and have explained the solution on the same.

                            To perform general purpose parallel computations, recent GPUs, which have many processing units connected 
                            with a global memory can be used. GPU architectures are increasingly important in the multi-core era due to 
                            their high number of parallel processors. Some large problems such as those of Image Processing and Pattern 
                            Recognition domains, involve carrying out the same operation repetitively. Such problems are categorized as 
                            graphics problems, and solved using a dedicated chip called GPU (Graphics Processing Unit). Using a programming 
                            architecture called CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), users can develop parallel programs running on GPUs. 
                            Canny edge detection algorithm is one of the most commonly used image processing algorithms to detect high-quality 
                            edges in images. Detecting sharp changes in the image brightness is important. That�s what image edge detection is 
                            all about. Hence detecting edges of an image is an important aspect in the world of digital image processing. This 
                            thesis implements a Canny Edge Detection algorithm in the GPU using CUDA C. For comparison purpose, the same 
                            algorithm is implemented in the CPU using Pthreads.

                            of security that its use has become pervasive in modern life. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
                            is one of the public-key cryptosystems that has been proven to be the most efficient public-key

                            with interesting properties.

                            The voting system is one of the great backbone for a democratic country for which the conventional systems or 
                            procedures are being followed from centuries. Either the ballot paper is used for voting organized by Election
                            Commission or the Electronic Voting Machine are being used. However, none of the systems are beyond the suspicion 
                            of transparency. The Electronic voting machine or ballot paper results in long queue for common people and elderly 
                            person with the possibility of duplicate voting or booth capturing. These scenarios demand a design and implementation 
                            of efficient electronic voting system that can�t be tampered at all. 
                            The technological advancements are leading towards the invention of newer technologies that is revolutionizing various 
                            field with its socio-economic impacts. Blockchain is one of these emerging technologies that have dragged all the 
                            attention of researchers for its capability of security and transparency. Blockchain refers to the growing list of 
                            record linked together with the use of cryptographic algorithm. The secure hashing techniques of SHA are used to 
                            generate hash with timestamp, transaction data and hash of previous block. This cryptographically linked list forms 
                            a distributed decentralized database of records in a peer to peer network where every peer holds a public ledger. 
                            The consensus of a majority of the participants verifies each and every transactions taking place in the network 
                            leading towards the tamper proof system from where transaction data once done can�t not be modified. 
                            Smart contracts, on the other hand, are a set of instructions or lines of codes deployed in the Blockchain platform 
                            which executes when the predefined terms and conditions are satisfied. The smart contract code facilitates, verifies, 
                            and enforces the negotiation or performance of an agreement or transaction. It is the simplest form of decentralized 
                            automation. This thesis intends to carry an in-depth and thorough study on Blockchain technologies and its implications. 
                            The thesis also investigates the issues and problems present in the online and offline voting system based on the 
                            current scenario and used infrastructure. The study in thesis also proposes an efficient online voting system leveraged 
                            by the non-tampering infrastructure provided by the Blockchain technology.

                            Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) has existed since the mid-1980s, but it is still looked on as the newcomer 
                            in the world of SSL, and has only begun to gain adoption in the past few years. ECC is a fundamentally different 
                            mathematical approach to encryption than the venerable RSA algorithm. An elliptic curve is an algebraic function 
                            ( ) which looks like a symmetrical curve parallel to the x axis when plotted. As with other forms of public key 
                            cryptography, ECC is based on a one-way property in which it is easy to perform a calculation but infeasible to 
                            reverse or invert the results of the calculation to find the original numbers. This elliptic curve has cardinality 
                            (curve order) by which we can calculate the point order of a point on the curve, this point order later uses in the 
                            cryptographic function. 
                            This thesis work focuses upon the detailed description of finding out the curve order of the elliptic curve using a
                            much more efficient way using Schoof�s algorithm. 
                            The implementation of Schoof�s algorithms for finding the curve order of elliptic curve in �C� is done by 
                            incorporating a special library called FLINT & MPFR Library which provides some features that gives faster processing 
                            for big integers. This library also includes the GMP library which supports the operation on big integers.

                            A blockchain is essentially a distributed database of records, that is public or private ledger of all transactions 
                            or digital events that have been executed and shared among participating parties. Blockchain has the potential 
                            to revolutionize the way we store data and manage information, potentially leading to reduced role for one of the 
                            most important regulatory actors in our society: the middleman, it enables the creation of decentralized systems. 
                            Blockchain was conceptualized with enhanced security in mind, cryptography being a major component of how a 
                            blockchain network operates. Transaction data recorded in the distributed ledger is immutable which is a major 
                            feature of blockchain, making it a promising prospect for application in a wide range of domains and industries. 
                            Digital currencies, self-executing digital contracts (smart contracts), distributed ledgers in banking system, 
                            automated supply chain monitoring and management of other digital assets can be implemented using blockchain amongst 
                            others. Since the concept of blockchain is relatively new, working on developing blockchain systems was restricted 
                            to using blockchain services in the form of APIs provided by platforms like Ethereum, where one can execute 
                            applications using smart contracts on the public blockchain hosted by Ethereum. One does not have control over the 
                            blockchain network and how it operates. Enterprises realised the immense potential that blockchain offers, and began 
                            developing their own proprietary blockchain solutions. In an effort to standardise blockchain development, 
                            the open-source project, Hyperledger hosted by Linux Foundation was created to advance cross-industry blockchain 
                            technologies. This thesis conducts a thorough study of blockchain technology and proposes a software architecture 
                            of a secure permissioned blockchain network which can be scaled. The system aims to demonstrate the modularity, 
                            robustness, scalability of blockchain networks that can be developed using the Hyperledger Fabric platform. This 
                            thesis tries to present the benefit of using certification authority for identity management, enabling secure 
                            permissioned access and operation in the blockchain network. Digital voting is treated as a use case that can benefit 
                            from this software architecture based on permissioned blockchain solutions. Development of the digital voting system, 
                            its drawbacks and proposed enhancements are also discussed.

                            A large-scale distributed system consisting of numerous computing entities like supercomputers or peer-to-peer 
                            resources are much more error prone due to several factors. Network fluctuations, lack of shared memory or some 
                            nodes� fault may leave the entire system into inconsistent state. So, for analyzing, verifying and testing properties 
                            associated with running executions it is imperative to record the system state and configuration. For that, several 
                            algorithms called snapshot algorithms have been implemented for years. Without compromising the underlying execution 
                            performance, focus has been put on reduction of communication cost as well as synchronization among all nodes in the system. 
                            In a large-scale distributed system, it is typically very difficult to predict the number of nodes participating in 
                            the sequence of execution. In this thesis, we present an efficient algorithm that works in a dynamic system which 
                            allows participating of nodes on-the-fly. Additionally, this implementation simulates capturing of snapshot in parallel 
                            way which makes it more resistant to concurrency problem. We have used latest technology of Python which enables the 
                            implementation more fast, consistent and accurate.

                            A scalable, secure and lightweight IoT device connector service is presented in this thesis. The proposed service 
                            acts as a framework to address the issue of scalability of device onboarding and as well to provide a cryptographically 
                            strong security on top of a lightweight IoT protocol. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is the best candidate 
                            for lightweight public key cryptography for resource constrained devices in IoT as ECC provides the same level of 
                            security as RSA but with reduced key size. The open source cryptographic library Networking and Cryptography Library 
                            (NACL) has emerged as a popular, lightweight and extremely reliable cryptography library using ECC. NACL provides 
                            easy to use API for popular security features like authenticated encryption, message authentication and digital 
                            signature using elliptic curve cryptography where the curve Curve25519 is both secure and computationally efficient 
                            for implementations on resource constrained devices. In our proposed system, the devices are connected to the server 
                            over lightweight Message Queue Telemetry Transport(MQTT) protocol and a state of the art ECC is used for public key 
                            authenticated encryption of the payload. The producer and consumer of data is decoupled and client applications of 
                            IoT service access the devices using JSON with HTTP REST API to enable the service for interface with other external 
                            IT systems over available HTTP interface, thus making the system scalable both in terms of device onboarding and as 
                            well as external service interfacing. ECC based NACL is used for public key cryptosystem implementing both key 
                            agreement and digital signature. The design of implemented system is presented. Experimental results shows that 
                            there is no significant variation in round-trip time compared between plain text and NACL encrypted payload. Also 
                            the performance test result of the IoT device connector service shows that the Little�s theorem is upheld.
